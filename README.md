# How to install

- Create a bot for every game server on: https://discord.com/developers/
- Add the generated tokens to the .env file inside the bot directory.
- Change the IP's and ports suited per your situation in: servers.json.

# Additional information
- If you run an Ark Survival Evolved dedicated server on the same machine as a Conan Exiles server, make sure to change it's port in the Engine.ini file of the Conan Exiles server, and the port in the servers.json of the bot. To prevent inteference between the servers.
